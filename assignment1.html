        Why I want to become developer?
    </h1>
    <p>
        As a Software Developer I constantly provide solutions for users' problems. I can be working on the occasional quick fix as well as more complex strategic solutions. Some problem-solving skills required to be a Software Developer include being able to split complex goals into smaller, more manageable ones.
